- 👋 Hi, I’m @harryc1112. I'm a second year PhD student in Finance at Stanford GSB. Previously, I was an RA and bank examiner at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
- 👀 I’m interested in finance and economics. I am especially interested in topics about banking, financial regulation and supervision, and household finance. I am also interested in access to credit and how the financial system facilitates or mitigates inequality. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and R (sometimes through ChatGPT), and have fun(!) experience with Stata and SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting research questions! Or to hear what you're working on.  
- 📫 How to reach me ... hcoop18@stanford.edu
